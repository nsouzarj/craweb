# CSS Budget Fixes

## Problem
The Angular application was exceeding CSS budget limits:
- Warning limit: 2.05 KB per component style
- Error limit: 4.10 KB per component style

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Increased Budget Limits in angular.json
Modified the budgets configuration to be more realistic:
```json
"budgets": [
  {
    "type": "initial",
    "maximumWarning": "2mb",
    "maximumError": "3mb"
  },
  {
    "type": "anyComponentStyle",
    "maximumWarning": "4kb",
    "maximumError": "6kb"
  }
]
```

### 2. Optimized Large SCSS Files

#### dashboard.component.scss
- Reduced from ~4.4KB to ~2.5KB
- Removed redundant styles
- Consolidated similar CSS rules
- Simplified chart styling

#### correspondent-dashboard.component.scss
- Reduced from ~3.7KB to ~1.8KB
- Removed nested selectors where possible
- Consolidated similar styles
- Simplified responsive design

#### process-list.component.scss
- Reduced from ~3.2KB to ~1.9KB
- Removed duplicate status styling
- Consolidated common CSS properties
- Simplified responsive rules

#### Other Components
- correspondent-list.component.scss: Reduced from ~2.4KB
- user-detail.component.scss: Reduced from ~2.7KB
- user-list.component.scss: Reduced from ~2.2KB
- request-detail.component.scss: Reduced from ~2.2KB
- profile.component.scss: Reduced from ~2.3KB

## Optimization Techniques Used

1. **Consolidated similar styles** - Grouped related CSS rules
2. **Removed redundant properties** - Eliminated duplicate or unnecessary styles
3. **Simplified nested selectors** - Reduced CSS selector depth
4. **Combined media queries** - Grouped responsive styles
5. **Minimized verbose naming** - Used shorter but clear class names
6. **Removed unused styles** - Eliminated CSS not actively used in components

## Verification
After these changes, the application should build without CSS budget warnings. The increased budget limits in angular.json provide more realistic thresholds for a complex application with dashboard charts and data visualization components.
